## Usage

This application uses NerdStorage to store and retrieve your Github personal access token. You can then configure a GraphQl query and trigger it to retrieve the specified data from your account.

Ideally, it will iterate through your data and display it in a table.

There are quite a few TODOs in the code - the nerdlet has a lot of potential.
